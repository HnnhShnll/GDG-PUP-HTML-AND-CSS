    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Good day, everyone! I am Hannah Shanelle L. Rejuso, and you can call me
      Elle. I am 19 years old from Taytay, Rizal, and I am currently taking a
      Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Polytechnic University of
      the Philippines - Sta. Mesa. I am an introvert, but when I am around the
      people I trust and am comfortable with, I am very talkative. I chose
      Computer Science as my course even though I graduated from senior high
      school without any background in programming, as I aspire to be a web
      developer and a software developer.
      <strong>I hope all of us will have fun while learning!</strong>

    <h2>My Hobby</h2>
    <p>
      I first learned about badminton when I was 5 years old, and since then, I
      started to love it. Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport played inside a
      court and can be played casually or competitively. Singles or doubles can
      play this sport, but I prefer to play in doubles as it comforts me knowing
      I have a partner inside the court. Also, playing badminton in doubles
      taught me the importance of communication and teamwork inside the court to
      achieve our goal of winning.

    <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
    <p>
      I love playing badminton, as hitting the shuttlecock helps me relieve my
      stress. I also love meeting new people and gaining friends because of
      playing badminton. I love the adrenaline rush that it gives me, especially
      if the game is intense. I also love the mental and physical challenge that
      it gives me during training and the game. Playing badminton helps me
      enhance my thinking and decision-making skills. Aside from that, playing
      badminton also helps me exercise.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Badminton is more than just a hobby to me. Playing it helps me keep my
      lifestyle active. It also lets me connect with others, have fun, and
      relieve stress. This sport is an excellent way for people to challenge
      themselves while enjoying the game. I look forward to continuing to love
      and enjoy this sport for years.
